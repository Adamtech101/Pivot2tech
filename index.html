       <h1>How to make a digestive biscuit</h1>
      
       <p>This is a step by step guide on how to make scrumptious digestive biscuits</p>

       <h3>Ingredients to buy</h3>

       <ul>
          <li>Wholewheat flour</li>
          <li>baking powder</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Powedered sugar</li>
          <li>Butter</li>
          <li>Milk</li>
       <ul>
      
      <h3>Steps to make the biscuit</h3>
      
      <p>This should take you around 45 minutes overall to make, even though it will get devoured in seconds. Still worth it.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Firstly, Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.</li>
          <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl and mix to combine the ingredients.</li>
          <li>Quickly, working with your fingertips or a blender, rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the milk and work through to form a dough.</li>
          <li>Turn out on a floured surface and roll to form a smooth dough. (IF your dough seems dry add a little more milk.)</li>
          <li>Using a well-floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to a bit more than 1/8 inch thick and cut into rounds, about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. You can keep rolling the scraps together to make additional biscuits.
          </li>
          <li>Transfer the biscuits to your baking pan and, if desired, prick the biscuits with a fork to create holes. Bake for 20 minutes until biscuits are pale gold.</li>
          <li>Cover and store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. </li>
          <li>
              Make a cuppa and start dipping!
          </li>
