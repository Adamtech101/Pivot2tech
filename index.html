<p>This should take you around 45 minutes overall to make, even though it will get devoured in seconds. Still worth it.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Firstly, Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl and mix to combine the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Quickly, working with your fingertips or a blender, rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the milk and work through to form a dough.</li>
    <li>Turn out on a floured surface and roll to form a smooth dough. (IF your dough seems dry add a little more milk.)</li>
    <li>Using a well-floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to a bit more than 1/8 inch thick and cut into rounds, about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. You can keep rolling the scraps together to make additional biscuits.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer the biscuits to your baking pan and, if desired, prick the biscuits with a fork to create holes. Bake for 20 minutes until biscuits are pale gold.</li>
    <li>Cover and store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. </li>
    <li>
        Make a cuppa and start dipping!
    </li>
